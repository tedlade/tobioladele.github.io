		<p>Wood is simply an online shop for furniture. The furniture they make are designed and produced locally by the company. They wanted to brand the company as classy. The furniture they make are also very minimalist.</p>
		<p>I worked closely with them taking notes of their values especially the tone of products they produce. We came to terms about what they wanted. White stands for class and brings out the tiny details from things. They also did not have a very wide range of products to display on the website which led to the big images which gives an amazing level of exposure to each product.</p>
